# Elliptic-Curves-Comprehensive-Library
This code is aimed at replacing the manual and tedious computations associated with the elliptic curves. The module is equiped with several useful utilities for group operations on points on elliptic curves:
1- **Finding points on an elliptic curve defined by Weierstrass equation.**
2- **Testing whether the curve is *singular* or *non-singular*.**
```
my_curve = EllipticCurves.ELL_CURVES(1,1,5)
