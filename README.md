# Elliptic-Curves-Comprehensive-Library
This code is aimed at replacing the manual and tedious computations associated with the elliptic curves. The module is equiped with several useful utilities for group operations on points on elliptic curves:
1. **Finding points on an elliptic curve defined by Weierstrass equation.**
2. **Testing whether the curve is *singular* or *non-singular*.**
3. **Finding all pairs of *(a,b)* for curves defined over a prime number *p*.**
4. **Finding non-singular curves defined over the prime *p* with *n* points.**
5. **Performing group law over points belonging to the elliptic curve.**
6. **Scalar multiplication of points.**
7. **Finding order of a point.**
8. **Finding points that generate the elliptic curve.**
9. **Generating Public-key for Elgamal Encryption scheme.***
10. **Encrypting and Decrypting data represented as points on the elliptic curve using Elgamal Encryption scheme.**
