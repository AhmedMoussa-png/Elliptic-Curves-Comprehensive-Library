# Elliptic-Curves-Comprehensive-Library
This project is aimed at producing a comprehensive software for the basic operations associated with the mathemaics of Elliptic Curves defined over prime fields and Elliptic Curves Cryptography. The mathematical structure for the elliptic curves in this software provide opportunity to find the list of points on any elliptic curve, add two points, mulitply a point by a scalar, finding order of a point, finding all possible elliptic curves defined over a certain prime field, and generator points. The software is also equipped with an encryption and decryption scheme based on El Gamal Encryption for elliptic curves.
